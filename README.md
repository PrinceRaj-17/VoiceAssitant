# VoiceAssitant

A Simple and very limited Voice Assistant.

Functions:-

1) It has Wake up call "hi tony"

2) Connect to your Google Account and Check Your Calendar for any Reminders after you authorize it.

3) Make a Note For You using Notepad

I'll be adding more functions and updating it.

Commands:-

1) "hi tony" -  wake up call after executing the program

2) "make a note" or "write this down" - make note for you using notepad

3) "what do i have on friday" or "what do i have on November 9" - check your google calendar to find any events on that day.

4) "stop" - exit the program

More new Features are coming soon...

Feel free for suggestions and modifying this program...

Thank You.
